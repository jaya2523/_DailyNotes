*Difference between file storage, block and object storage*
1. In File storage data is in heirarchichal format and in Block data is in fragmented way and can use file storage over it.
2. In object storage data will access through api's and it will use high level and block will use low level.
3. for backup only need to update particular block and in object need to create the whole new file
4. In block we dont have metdata about the file but in block we have.
5. Blocks are stored in volumes and Objects are stored in Buckets.
6. may get complicated and higher in cost when fragmented in block.

# Understanding Linux File Permissions

In Linux, file permissions are represented as:

<br> rw-rw-rw--


Where:
- **User**: The owner of the file
- **Group**: Users belonging to the same group as the file's group
- **Other**: Everyone else

### Permission Values
- **Read (r)** = 4
- **Write (w)** = 2
- **Execute (x)** = 1

The permission values are summed up as:
- **Read (4)** + **Write (2)** + **Execute (1)** = **7**

### `chmod 777` Command
The `chmod 777` command gives **full access** (read, write, and execute) to the file or directory for:
- **User**
- **Group**
- **Other**

This means everyone has the ability to read, write, and execute the file or folder.

#### Example:
```bash
chmod 777 file.txt
